Welcome to the repository for Fighting Flow!

This is a passion project to create an app for beginner Tekken players who want to learn the combos and display them on their phone while playing the game.

I'm currently working on a stable version of this app which will allow users to create, edit and delete combos. This will be the basic version of the app, later on in development I am hoping to add a way to
create playlists with your combos with a timer that allows you to practice one combo for 5 minutes, then the next one for 5 minutes and so on, potentially with adjustable timers for each combo if one is more
difficult to execute than others.

To try out the app for yourself, download the zip file using the Green code button at the top and extract the fighting-flow-debug.apk. You can then add this file to your android device or emulator. I've tested it using Bluestack on PC and it works well. If you've tried the app and are enjoying it or want to give me some feedback do not hesitate to get in contact.
