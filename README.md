Welcome to the repository for Fighting Flow!

This is a passion project to create an app for beginner Tekken players who want to learn the combos and display them on their phone while playing the game.

I'm currently working on a stable version of this app which will allow users to create, edit and delete combos. This will be the basic version of the app, later on in development I am hoping to add a way to
create playlists with your combos with a timer that allows you to practice one combo for 5 minutes, then the next one for 5 minutes and so on, potentially with adjustable timers for each combo if one is more
difficult to execute than others.
